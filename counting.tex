\section{Counting Edge Covers}

Finally, we present the procedures for approximately counting edge covers given good estimations of the marginal probability $P(G,e)$, hence an FPTAS for the approximate counting of edge covers problem.

\begin{Prop}
	
	Let $Z(G) \triangleq \norm{EC(G)}$, order the set of edges in $G$ in any order as $\set{e_i}$

\[ Z(G) = \frac{1}{\prod_i^m (1 - P(G_i, e_i))} \]

\end{Prop}

$m$ edges, 
take $L=O(\log m + \log(1/ \epsilon))$

TODO.
