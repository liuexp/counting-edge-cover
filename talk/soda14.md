First of all, what is an edge cover.

# Edge Covers
This concept is from graph theory and belongs to the class of covering problems.
Given an undirected input graph, an edge cover of it is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to at least one edge from the set.

Here is an example, we highlight the edges being chosen. On the left, the edges chosen turns out to be not only an edge cover, but also a perfect matching, while on the right is a maximum matching but not an edge cover.

In fact, a perfect matching is always a minimum edge cover. But the converse is not true.

# Counting problem

# Motivation & Comments

Edge cover is related to many problems:
* Matching: a perfect matching is a minimum edge cover. Both enforce a constraint on vertex, matching is at most one, and edge cover is at least one.

Comparisons of Paradigms: MCMC vs. correlation decay.
