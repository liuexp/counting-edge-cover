\section{Open Problems}
We have presented an FPTAS for approximately counting the number of edge covers for any graph. Similarly as the counting weighted independent sets with fugacity parameter $\lambda$, a natural question to ask is whether there is also an FPTAS for approximately counting weighted edge covers, or formally, is there an FPTAS to approximate the following partition function $Z_G(\lambda)$:
\[Z_G(\lambda) \triangleq \sum_{X \in EC(G)} \lambda^{\abs{X}}\]

Also, will there be a phase transition as in the case of counting independent sets? Note that our current approach can be directly extended to the case where $\lambda$ is not too small (e.g. $\lambda > \frac{4}{9}$), leaving the region where $\lambda$ being small open.

As we have noted previously, an alternative view point of the edge cover problem is Rtw-Mon-CNF, hence other natural problems are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For what integer value of $k$, counting read $k$ times monotone CNF admits an FPTAS?
	\item For counting read twice CNF (Rtw-CNF), is there an FPTAS?
\end{itemize}
We remark that Rtw-CNF admits FPRAS~\cite{TwiceSAT}, while even counting read thrice 2CNF (without the monotone restriction) is as hard as counting 2CNF (without the read restriction) and hence does not admit FPRAS unless $RP=NP$.
In general, it is of interest to see how far the correlation decay technique could get in designing FPTAS for counting problems.
