\section{Counting Edge Covers}

Finally, we present the procedures for approximately counting edge covers given good estimations of the marginal probability $P(G,e)$, hence an FPTAS for the approximate counting of edge covers problem.

Let $Z(G) \triangleq \norm{EC(G)}$,

\[ Z(G) = \frac{1}{\prod_i (1 - P(G_i, e_i))} \]

$m$ edges, 
take $L=O(\log m + \log(1/ \epsilon))$

TODO.
