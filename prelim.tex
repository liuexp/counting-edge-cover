\subsection{Definitions}
An edge cover of a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex has at least an adjacent edge in it.

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge $e$,  we use $EC(G)$ to denote the set of all edge covers of graph $G$, and $P(G, e)$ to denote the marginal probability over $EC(G)$ that edge $e$ is not chosen, or formally, with $X \sim EC(G)$ uniformly,
\begin{equation}
	P(G, e) \triangleq \mathbb{P} \left(\textrm{edge $e$ is not chosen in $X$ } \right)
	\label{defpge}
\end{equation}

In this paper, we deal with an extended notion of undirected graphs where dangling edges and free edges may be allowed.
\begin{Def}
	A {\bf dangling edge} $e=(u,\_)$ of a graph is such singleton edge with only one end-point vertex $u$, as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:G}.

	A {\bf free edge} $e=(\_, \_)$ of a graph is such edge with no end-point vertex. Note that a free edge is not a dangling edge.

%	A graph with at least one dangling edge is called {\bf non-trivial dangling graph}.
%
%	We use {\bf non-dangling graphs} to refer to graphs containing neither dangling edges, nor free edges, and not trivial dangling graphs.

\end{Def}

	So we use graph to refer graphs in the usual sense with or without dangling edges or free edges.
	Edges in the usual sense (i.e. not dangling and not free), will be refered to as normal edges, 
	and graphs with only normal edges(i.e. graphs in the usual sense) will be refered to as normal graphs.

	We remark that an alternative view to these combinatorial definitions is from Rtw-Mon-CNF,
	a dangling edge is just a variable which only appears at one clause, and a free edge is a variable
	that does not appear at all, whereas normal edge just corresponds to variables appearing twice.

\subsection{Notations}
For a graph $G=(V,E)$ and an edge (may or may not be normal) $e \in E$, let $G-e \triangleq (V, E-e)$, and $G-v \triangleq (V-\set{v}, \set{(x,y):x\neq v, y\neq v, (x,y) \in E} \cup \set{(x,\_):(v,x) \in E})$.

For example, given a degree-3 vertex $u$ with dangling edge $e$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:G} , the result of $G-e-u$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:G-e-u}.

We use $0$ to denote scalar value $0$, and $\mathbf{0}$ to denote vector value 0, and $\set{e_i}_{i=1}^{d}$ denote the $d$-dimensional vector with $i$-th coordinate being $e_i$, so $\set{e_i} = \mathbf{0}$ means $\forall i, e_i = 0$.
